### This is a page of mine, which contains some projects I currently making.

###### Well...atleast for scratch projects.

For Codemon, here's some description:
 1. It's a scratch ver Pokemon.
 2. It's made by myself.
 3. The engine has been made about half, but there's just little content.
 4. To enter the game, you should watch or skip the animation showed in the begining.
    If you want to skip it, press `k`(equals to the A botton/confirm botton).
    Then, please press `k` again and wait for the screen until it turned white.
    After that, press `g`, waiting again, and press `i` and `r` step by step.
 5. To play and enjoy the game, please walk into the nearest house(unless I've made the story about the truck).
    Using `wsad` to move the player. Using `j` to cancel.

For ISOBALL..

For MÎ±ths II..

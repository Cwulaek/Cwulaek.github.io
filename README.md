### This is a page of mine, which contains some projects I currently making.

###### Well...atleast for scratch projects.

For Codemon, here's some description:
 1. It's a scratch ver Pokemon(Unofficial).
 2. It's made by myself.
 3. The engine has been made about half, but there's just little content.
 4. To enter the game, you should watch or skip the animation showed in the begining.
    If you want to skip it, press `k`(equals to the A botton/confirm botton).
    Then, please press `k` again and wait for the screen until it turned white.
    After that, press `g`, waiting again, and press `i` and `r` step by step.
 5. To play and enjoy the game, please walk into the nearest house(unless I've made the story about the truck).
    Using `wsad` to move the player. Using `j` to cancel.

For Parabox, here's some description:
 1. It's a scratch ver Parabox(Unofficial).
 2. The Images are not used from the origin game(while, for Codemon, yes).
 3. The engine hadn't made completely, so there is some function I'd not applied.
 4. After entering the game, You could use \` and `=` to open config(they are different configs)
 5. Using `wsad` to move the player. Using `z` to undo, `x` to redo, and `r` to reset(resetting is undo-able).

For ISOBALL, here's some description:
 1. It's a scratch ver ISOBALL(Unofficial).
 2. I've no good drawing skills, so the textures are simple.
 3. The different coloured blocks are using the same costumes, and the colours are changed by code.
 4. Use 1~8/click to select, scroll to turn the selected block.
 5. Use click/r to run. Use click/\` to select eraser.
 6. On build mode(selected in main page), use 9/0 to select the doors, and use - to select the teleporter.
